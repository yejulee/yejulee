I am YeJu Lee, a third-year Honors College and Douglass Residential College student at Rutgers University-New Brunswick.
I am double majoring in Business Analytics & Information Technology (BAIT) and Computer Science with a Korean-English Translation & Interpreting certificate.
It's always a pleasure to talk to new people and learn something new, so please let me know what's been interesting to you!
